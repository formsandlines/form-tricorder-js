# FORM tricorder

<br/>

**FORM tricorder** is a helpful tool for researchers and enthusiasts based on my FORM logic library [**formform**](https://github.com/formsandlines/formform). It can calculate, analyze and visualize all 4-valued FORMs of the calculus introduced by Ralf Peyn in uFORM iFORM.

To use the app, follow this link: [tricorder.formform.dev](http://tricorder.formform.dev).

## Further information

If you want to learn more about the calculus, ideas and theories *formform* is based on, here are some helpful resources:

- [About uFORM iFORM](https://uformiform.info) (mostly German as is the language of the book by Ralf Peyn, but you can try [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to translate the gist of it)
- [Here is a list of links](https://uformiform.info/#section_recommendations) on the theoretical background behind uFORM iFORM (mostly German resources, but you can just translate the keywords and google them)
- [3-dimensional FORM animations and FORM-builder](https://uformiform.info/animations) (a project I made back in 2017 that greatly influenced my approach to formform)
- [Blog s y s t e m z e i t](https://carl-auer-akademie.com/blogs/systemzeit/) by Gitta Peyn – German and English articles about systemic research based on uFORM iFORM
- [About FORMWELT](https://formwelt.info) – a coding language for language and meaning founded on the logic of cognition introduced in uFORM iFORM (by the way, we appreciate any support for the development of [FORMWELT Online](https://formwelt.info/formwelt-online)!)
